       Raeflo Mobile Application End User License Agreement
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
This Raeflo Mobile Application End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding agreement between you ("<strong>End User</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") and <strong>Avenge Media LLC </strong>("<strong>Avenge Media</strong>",<strong> </strong>" <strong>we</strong>", <strong>"our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").
    This Agreement governs your use on your mobile device of the compiled,
    executable <strong>Natrium </strong>mobile application released by
us, and all related documentation (collectively, the "    <strong>Application</strong>").
</p>
<p>
    The Application is licensed (not sold) to you, pursuant to and subject to
    your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
</p>


<p align="center">
    <strong><u>DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    THE APPLICATION IS OWNED, OPERATED AND RELEASED BY UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES
    ONLY. AVENGE MEDIA IS INDEPENDENT OF, AND OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM,
    THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, OPERATING, MAINTAINING OR SUPPORTING
    THE NANO PROTOCOL, THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK, THE NANO CURRENCY OR ANY
    SOFTWARE WALLET THAT IS NOT RELEASED BY UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES (COLLECTIVELY,
    "<strong>SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES</strong>"). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, AVENGE
    MEDIA LLC DOES NOT OWN, DEVELOP, OPERATE, MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT ANY OF
    THE SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES.
</p>
<p>
    YOUR USE OF THE
    APPLICATION AND YOUR CREATION AND ACCESSING OF A WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (A "<strong>WALLET</strong>") USING THE APPLICATION DOES
    NOT INVOLVE THE OPENING, ESTABLISHING OR MANAGING OF AN "ACCOUNT" WITH UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES; 
    INSTEAD, YOU ARE USING THE APPLICATION TO INTERACT WITH THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK AND YOUR WALLET/ACCOUNTS ON
    THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK, AND ARE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS BETWEEN FIAT AND NANO.
    IN THE EVENT OF REGULATORY MEASURES, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE ANY USER DATA WE COLLECT. 
    PLEASE SEE THE PRIVACY DOCUMENT FOR INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR DATA FOOTPRINT.
  </p>
<p>
    A "<strong>WALLET SEED</strong>" IS A UNIQUE CODE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU
    BY THE APPLICATION, THROUGH ITS DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THE NANO BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (I.E., WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT) WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW
    WALLET USING THE APPLICATION. YOUR WALLET SEED IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO
    RECOVER YOUR WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK AND ACCESS ANY NANO
    CURRENCY YOU STORE IN THAT WALLET.
</p>
<p>
    WE DO NOT RECEIVE, COLLECT, RECORD, STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET
    SEED. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT RECOVER IT FOR YOU IF YOU LOSE IT AND WE CANNOT
    PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU STORE IN YOUR WALLET.
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING YOUR WALLET SEED IN A SAFE AND
    SECURE PLACE AND MANNER. DO NOT SHARE YOUR WALLET SEED WITH ANYONE, OR
    PERMIT ANYONE TO USE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS
    INSTALLED WHO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET OR YOUR NANO
    CURRENCY.
</p>

  <p>
     WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO CONVERT BETWEEN NANO AND FIAT, BY DEPOSITING FIAT THROUGH OUR PORTAL, OR WITHDRAWING
     NANO TO DEPOSIT FIAT INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES GUARANTEES THE TRANSACTION WILL BE CARRIED OUT
    SUCCESSFULLY, AND ANY REQUIRED FUNDS WILL BE DEPOSITED PROMPTLY. 
    ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE,
    SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION, AND ANY BALANCE AND TRANSACTION
    INFORMATION RELATING TO IT, ARE NEVER UNNECESARILY ACCESSED, HELD, STORED, MANAGED,
    RECEIVED, SENT OR TRANSMITTED BY UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE EVENT THIS DATA IS STORED
    (FOR DEPOSITS OR WITHDRAWALS), IT WILL ONLY BE STORED FOR AS LONG AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE TRANSACTION IS SUCCESFUL
  </p>

<p>
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOUR
    NANO CURRENCY, AND YOUR WALLET SEED. UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES IS NOT AND WILL
    NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE SECURITY OR PROTECTION OF YOUR
    NANO CURRENCY OR WALLET SEED.
</p>
<p>
      
  
    YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES
    DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE
    SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY, SUITABILITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE APPLICATION OR
